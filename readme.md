# Sentinel
Sentinel is a game made to showcase the [Java PGFramework](https://github.com/P2LGames/PGFramework) and its functionality.  
Developers can use it as an example, or fork it and make a cool game with it!  

Personally note from Luzzotica, the game dev that made this and assisted in the development of the PGF: I feel that the game design is pretty novel, and that the reprogrammability of the Sentinels themselves is a super cool concept that deserves more exploration, and more ideas beyond my own.
