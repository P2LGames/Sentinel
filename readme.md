# Sentinel
Sentinel is a game made to showcase the [Java PGFramework](https://github.com/P2LGames/PGFramework) and its functionality.  
Developers can use it as an example, or fork it and make a cool game with it!  

## How to Run
Requirements
- Made using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine. Godot is required to run it. There is no distributed version.
- The JRE is required to run this as well, as it spins a up a java jar.

After downloading Godot and the JRE, open up this project using Godot and run it. Everything should work beautifully.

### Developer's Note from Luzzotica
I feel that the design of this game is pretty novel. The reprogrammability of the Sentinels themselves is a super cool concept that deserves more exploration, and more ideas beyond my own. Please, take the project and make something amazing with it!
