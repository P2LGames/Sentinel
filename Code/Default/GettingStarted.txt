This is the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for Sentinel!

In the top left is the robot you currently have selected. You can change his name whenever you would like.

Beneath that are the files you have access to. RobotOverride will be the one you want to use.

Further down are the recompile, save, and close buttons.
- Recompile will attempt to recompile the code file you currently have selected onto the robot you have selected (His name is in the top left).
- Save will save the current file. You can also press ctrl+s or command+s to save the current file.
- Close, the "x" in the top right of the window, or pressing escape will close the IDE.

At the bottom you will find the output. The output will be filled with the output of the robot that you currently have selected.
The output will also give you details of compilation, letting you know if it was successful, or if there were errors.

Good programming!
